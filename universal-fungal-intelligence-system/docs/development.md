# Development Guidelines for the Universal Fungal Intelligence System

## Introduction
The Universal Fungal Intelligence System is designed to analyze fungal species and their chemical compounds for potential therapeutic applications. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the development of the project.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/universal-fungal-intelligence-system.git
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```
   cd universal-fungal-intelligence-system
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Development Workflow
1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes. The naming convention is `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bug-name>`.
   - Always branch off from the `main` branch.

2. **Code Style**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Write docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
   - Place tests in the `tests/unit` directory for unit tests and `tests/integration` for integration tests.
   - Run tests using pytest:
   ```
   pytest
   ```

4. **Documentation**
   - Update the documentation in the `docs` directory as necessary.
   - Ensure that any new features are documented in `usage.md`.

## Contribution
1. **Submitting Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
   - Push your changes to your feature branch.
   - Create a pull request against the `main` branch.

2. **Code Review**
   - All pull requests will be reviewed by at least one other developer.
   - Address any feedback provided during the review process.

## Conclusion
Thank you for contributing to the Universal Fungal Intelligence System! Your efforts help advance our understanding of fungal species and their potential benefits for human health.
