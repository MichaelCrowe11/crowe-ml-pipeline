# Usage Instructions for the Universal Fungal Intelligence System

## Overview
The Universal Fungal Intelligence System (UFIS) is designed to analyze fungal species and their chemical compounds for potential therapeutic applications. This document provides instructions on how to use the system effectively.

## Installation
Before using UFIS, ensure that you have installed all necessary dependencies. Refer to the [installation guide](installation.md) for detailed instructions.

## Running the Application
To start the Universal Fungal Intelligence System, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the system and prepare it for analysis.

## Analyzing Fungal Species
1. **Collect Data**: The system automatically collects data from various fungal databases. You can initiate this process by calling the `analyze_global_fungal_kingdom` method from the `UniversalFungalIntelligence` class.

2. **Analyze Chemical Composition**: Once the data is collected, the system analyzes the chemical composition of the collected fungal species. This is done through the `MolecularAnalyzer` class.

3. **Identify Breakthrough Compounds**: The system identifies unique and novel compounds with potential therapeutic applications using the `BreakthroughIdentifier` class.

4. **Predict Molecular Modifications**: The `SynthesisPredictor` class predicts possible modifications to enhance the therapeutic effects of identified compounds.

5. **Assess Therapeutic Potential**: The system evaluates the therapeutic potential of the compounds through the `BioactivityPredictor` class.

## Generating Reports
After completing the analysis, you can generate comprehensive reports on the findings. Use the report generation functions located in the `src/reports/generators` directory.

## Example Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use the system in a Python script:

```python
from src.core.fungal_intelligence import UniversalFungalIntelligence

# Initialize the system
fungal_ai = UniversalFungalIntelligence()

# Analyze the global fungal kingdom
analysis_results = fungal_ai.analyze_global_fungal_kingdom()

# Generate a report based on the analysis
report = fungal_ai.generate_breakthrough_discovery_report(analysis_results)

# Print the report
print(report)
```

## Conclusion
The Universal Fungal Intelligence System is a powerful tool for mycochemists and researchers interested in fungal species and their therapeutic potential. For further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact the development team.
